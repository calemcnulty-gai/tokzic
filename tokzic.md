Tokzic Architectural Document
1. Introduction
Tokzic is a mobile video app designed to provide engaging, short-form video content with a swipe-based user interaction model similar to Tinder. The app targets rapid, attention-grabbing content consumption and is built with scalability in mind. Future AI enhancements (e.g., personalized recommendations, content moderation, semantic search via Pinecone Vector DB) are an integral part of the roadmap.

2. High-Level Technical Choices
2.1 Mobile Framework & Platform
React Native with Expo:
Why: Expo simplifies setup and deployment for iOS and Android without requiring extensive native code management. It’s perfect for rapid iteration and has excellent support for live reloading and debugging.
Future-Proofing: Its modular architecture lets us easily introduce native modules when needed later.
2.2 State Management
Redux (with Redux Toolkit):
Provides a predictable state container for managing global state.
Facilitates debugging and offers tools for time-travel debugging.
Modular when combined with React Native, and can scale with our app’s complexity.
2.3 Backend Services
Firebase Suite:
Authentication: Using Firebase Auth for user sign-up/in, social logins, etc.
Storage: For managing video uploads and static assets.
Database: Cloud Firestore (or Realtime DB) for storing user profiles, video metadata, interactions, etc.
Firebase Functions:
To handle server-side operations such as:
Incrementing view counts.
Generating video recommendations.
Running any custom business logic.
Future AI Integration:
Pinecone Vector DB: To support AI-driven features such as semantic search or personalized content recommendations.
Separation: AI-related functions will be isolated in dedicated Firebase Functions, planning for a distinct API layer or microservice.

3. System Components & Architecture
3.1 Mobile App (Frontend)
User Interface:
Developed in React Native.
Features a TikTok-like vertical video feed alongside Tinder-style swipe interactions.
Navigation:
Use React Navigation to manage screens (e.g., Home, Video Detail, Profile, Matches).
State Management:
Use Redux to maintain app state including user data, video feed, and navigation context.
Services/Integration:
Dedicated services to abstract Firebase interactions.
Stub modules for future AI integration (e.g., services/ai.ts) to separate concerns.
Directory Structure (suggested):

  /Tokzic
     /assets        # Images, fonts, and static files
     /components    # Reusable UI components (Buttons, VideoCard, SwipeOverlay, etc.)
     /screens       # Distinct screens (HomeScreen, DetailScreen, ProfileScreen, etc.)
     /redux         # Redux slices, store configuration, and middleware
     /services      # Firebase, AI (stub), Analytics, etc.
     /utils         # Utility functions and TypeScript types

3.2 Firebase Backend
Authentication Module:
Managed using Firebase Auth.
User tokens, OAuth integration, and session management.
Database Design:
Collections:
users — user profiles, preferences, and statistics.
videos — video metadata (URLs, upload timestamps, engagement metrics, etc.).
swipes or matches — record of swipe actions, likes, or "matches".
Storage:
Organize video contents in Firebase Storage with appropriate security rules.
Serverless Functions:
Handle background operations like updating view counts, processing engagements, and later, AI tasks.
Planned AI Integration:
Define a modular design in Firebase Functions to enable integration with Pinecone Vector DB.
Future enhancements can include indexing video metadata and user behavior patterns for personalized recommendations.

4. Design Principles & Guidelines
4.1 Modular and Composable Code
Separation of Concerns:
Keep UI components separate from business logic.
Isolate side effects (e.g., Firebase calls) in service modules.
Pure Functions:
Favor pure functions in Redux reducers and helper utilities to ensure deterministic outputs.
Maintainability:
Write clear, concise functions (preferably under 60 lines each) and files organized to remain under recommended sizes.
Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
4.2 Future-Proofing AI Features
Placeholder Modules:
Create stub services (e.g., services/ai.ts) to define interface boundaries.
This makes it easier to swap or stub out AI functionality as the project evolves.
Microservices:
Plan for Firebase Functions to act as microservices capturing AI logic separate from the main business logic.

5. Development Process & Timeline
5.1 Rapid MVP Build (48 Hours Target)
Day 1:
Set up React Native project with Expo.
Integrate basic Redux state management.
Build core screens: Home (video feed), Video Detail, and Profile.
Integrate Firebase for Auth, Storage, and DB interactions.
Day 2:
Polish navigation with React Navigation.
Implement video uploading and streaming interfaces.
Create Firebase Functions stubs for background operations.
Prepare placeholders for future AI features.
Test on both Android and iOS through Expo.
Ensure basic error handling and a responsive user experience.

6. Future Enhancements
AI-Based Recommendations:
Develop dedicated Firebase Functions that interact with Pinecone Vector DB.
Build out the AI module to analyze and recommend content based on user behavior.
Enhanced User Interactions:
Refine swipe mechanics and introduce Tinder-like matching algorithms.
Scalability & Performance:
Optimize Redux state and Firebase queries.
Monitor app performance and refine indexes in Firestore for faster queries.

7. Conclusion
The architectural strategy for Tokzic is built with a balance of rapid prototyping and future expansion. Leveraging React Native with Expo for the frontend, Redux for state management, and Firebase for authentication, storage, and database needs, we plan to deploy a functional MVP within 48 hours. Moreover, the design clearly separates concerns and paves the way for seamless integration of AI features and other future enhancements.
This modular, scalable architecture not only supports the initial launch of the app but also ensures that we have a robust foundation for continuous improvements and advanced feature integration over time.
