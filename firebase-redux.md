    - [x] `deleteFile`
    - [x] `listFiles`
    - [x] `getFileMetadata`
    - [x] `updateFileMetadata`
    - [x] `checkFileExists`
  - [x] Analytics thunks:
    - [x] `logEvent`
    - [x] `setUserProperties`
    - [x] `trackScreenView`
    - [x] `trackVideoEvent`
    - [x] `trackPerformance`
    - [x] `trackError`
    - [x] Session management

## Phase 3: State Management Updates ✅

  - [x] Auth selectors
  - [x] Firestore selectors
  - [x] Storage selectors
  - [x] Analytics selectors
  - [x] Loading state selectors
  - [x] Error state selectors

## Phase 4: Consumer Updates
