# Components

This directory contains reusable React Native components that are shared across different screens and features of the application.

## Structure
- Components should be organized in subdirectories by feature or type
- Each component should have its own directory containing:
  - The component file (ComponentName.tsx)
  - Styles (if applicable)
  - Tests
  - Type definitions (if needed)

## Guidelines
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Document complex props or behaviors
- Follow the project's naming conventions
