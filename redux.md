    - [x] Tip selector visibility
    - [x] Loading states
  - [x] Update components to follow new standard
    - [x] Update CommentPanel

## Success Criteria
- [x] Single source of truth for video playback
- [x] Consistent auth state management
- [x] Clear separation of concerns
- [x] Predictable UI state updates
- [ ] Improved performance
- [ ] Better maintainability
- [ ] Easier debugging

## Notes
